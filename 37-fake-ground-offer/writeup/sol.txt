-1, This isn't a uniform sampler at all - it is quite biased towards 0 and 1 (see jsfiddle.net/bhrLT/17, which may take a while to compute). Consecutive values are correlated - every 355 values, and even more so every 710, are related. Please use something more carefully thought-out! â€“

 Somehow you can find that formula (355/113) in expat passer confusion?
